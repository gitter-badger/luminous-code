## Why Luminous Code?
I wrote the *Luminous Code* framework to be a collection of projects, namespaces, classes, 
methods, and extention methods designed to keep the code that I write as
**DRY** as possible! It was/is driven by my own needs, but I'm happy to share it with anyone it can help.

Why would anyone want to write the same low-level code over and over in every class or method that you write,
figuring out the lines of code required to accomplish a task each and every time?
I don't know about you, but I **hate** doing that.

* Whenever I find myself writing the same code, I add that code into a new class or
method in the appropriate *Luminous Code* namespace or class.
* If I figure out **how** to do something new, I add also it into the framework.
That way I'm not constantly reinventing the wheel, so to speak.

## Does Your Code Have CAOI?
Lines of low-level code isn't necessarily all that easy to understand what it's actually
**trying** to do when you come back to it later! As developers, we call that the *intent* of the code.

The intent of any code that you write should be clear
and obvious to anyone who is using/maintaining your code (it may even be you). 

That's the reason that I created the *Luminous Code* framework, so I could use code that has *CAOI*
(**clear and obvious intent** - C.A.O.I.).
There's probably no point googling it, I'm pretty sure it was me that coined the accronym, lol. 

## Benefits

* Keeps your code as DRY as possible
* Allows your classes and methods to not break the
